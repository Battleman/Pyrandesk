# PyRanDesk
## Tests
<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Battleman/Pyrandesk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Battleman/Pyrandesk) -->
## General goal
This python script intends to dynamically modify the desktop regularly, based on one or more Imgur albums. I write this for my current distribution, that is debian testing (so far buster), with GNOME3. I can't promise this will work on any other system.


## Requirements

* Python Modules:
    * PIL (Pillow)

## Notes and thanks
The watermarking module was made mainly with the help of [the blog of thecodingcouple](http://www.thecodingcouple.com/watermark-images-python-pillow-pil/).
It was mainly copy-pasted, but I'm planning on improving it in the near future. Anyway, big up !
