# RandomImgurDesktop
## General goal
This python script intends to dynamically modify the desktop regularly, based on one or more Imgur albums. I write this for my current distribution, that is debian testing (so far buster), with GNOME3. I can't promise this will work on any other system.


## Requirements
So far, none.
